## Do you have a support Discord?

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/TnhxcqynZ2)](https://discord.gg/TnhxcqynZ2)
## Will I get banned for using this?   
You are breaking [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services) by using ArmCord, but no one has been banned from using it or any of the client mods included.

## Can I use this on anything other than ARM?
Yes! ArmCord should work normally under Windows, macOS, and Linux as long as it has Electron support.  

## How can I access the settings?
There should be a **Settings** button in your Discord settings with an ArmCord settings. Alternatively you can open ArmCord settings from the tray icon.

## How does this work?   
We are using the official web app and wrapping it up in Electron. While you may think this is lame and done like thousands of times before, what makes us unique is that we actually strive for creating a customized experience. You can very easily load themes and mods with no installers/injectors. You can even make the client have transparency effects and follow the fluent design of Windows! At its core, it's just a simple web wrapper, however, we applied many patches to make this work well for you <3

## Can I stream screenshare audio with it?
ArmCord only supports screensharing audio on Windows and **Linux**. Linux requires you to have PulseAudio installed on your system (or `pipewire-pulse`).

## Where can I find the source code?
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord/).

## Where can I translate this?
Translations are done using our [Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/armcord/armcord/).

## Does ArmCord have a privacy policy?
You can find it [here](https://armcord.app/privacy.txt).
